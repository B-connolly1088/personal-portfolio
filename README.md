# <Benjamin Connolly Portfolio>

## Description

This project was created to provide a professional portfolio for 
myself. My motivation for this project was to show potential employers 
my projects. This portfolio was made with HTML and CSS. In this project 
I was able to develop better knowledge with flexbox among other CSS and 
HTML structures.
